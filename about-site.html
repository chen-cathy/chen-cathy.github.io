<div class="subtitle">Let AI sprint first, then bring it under control</div>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>Origins: From a single idea to being hijacked by AI</h2>

<p>
The seed of this website began as a simple idea: to organize the research reports I accumulated during my master's studies in economics, law, and management. At the time, I didn't yet have a clear blueprint for the final form, but I knew that if I stayed in the mindset of "I'll think about it later," it would never come into being. With a "no harm done" attitude—believing that only by doing it would I know how to continue—I took the first step.
</p>

<p>
When I brought AI into the process, it quickly “took over.” It produced section summaries, generated the website’s HTML, and even “instructed” me: “Just upload the reports and let people download them.”
</p>

<p>
It was an interesting and surprising beginning. It made me realize one of AI’s core values: it is not just a tool, but a catalyst that can steer the direction of thinking.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-columns"></i>Turning point: toward a “pure-AI” dual-perspective structure</h2>

<p>
Since AI demonstrated such strong guiding power, I decided to push this experiment further: what would happen if I let AI “one-click generate” content from my reports? That is how the site’s core “Dual Perspective” structure came into being. This is not merely a functional design—it is a statement about how knowledge is produced:
</p>

<div class="dual-perspective-container">
<div class="perspective-block human-block">
<div class="block-title"><i class="fas fa-university"></i>Perspective One (upper section): Commitment to original research</div>
This is the crystallization of human intelligence working with AI. It preserves my original reports, ensuring rigor in theoretical modeling, discipline in methodological constraints, and integrity in data validation. It is a commitment to the essence of research, emphasizing the irreplaceability of original thinking.
</div>

<div class="perspective-block ai-block">
<div class="block-title"><i class="fas fa-robot"></i>Perspective Two (lower section): The explosive force of AI generation</div>
This is the showcase for AI’s “one-click generation.” It demonstrates how AI turns complex text into front-end code, implements interactive charts, and runs calculations in real time. It represents new possibilities for efficiency, visualization, and the transformation of information.
</div>
</div>

<div class="attitude-summary">
<strong>This is not just a feature, but an attitude</strong>
I acknowledge the value of AI’s transformation power because it can turn complex content into visualized formats more quickly; but I also insist that original research is irreplaceable, because ideas, constraints, and validation do not appear automatically.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>Platform choice: when multiple AIs gave the same answer</h2>

<p>
Early in this experiment, I had to make a crucial decision: where should this website be hosted? I consulted all the major AI models at the time — Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. Their advice was strikingly consistent: Google Sites—for backend management, consistency, and ease of filling in text.
</p>

<p>
Having never used it, I only had a vague sense of what it could do. But both trial and error cost time, so I didn’t follow the advice blindly. Instead, I asked AI to show me what it considered the best Google Sites examples, so I could see its real range of capabilities. I recognized its strengths, but also confirmed its limits: not enough flexibility, and layouts and interactions that were hard to adjust to my way of working.
</p>

<p>
This ran counter to my goal of exploring the boundaries of AI development. In the end, I chose GitHub as the main platform—not because it is “cooler,” but because it lets me treat the site as an iterative system: I can experiment freely, control versions, and gradually turn workflows into templates. It is challenging for non-IT users, but that is also part of what makes the AI era fascinating: learning curves and learning costs have both been reduced.
</p>

<p>
This process left a deep impression on me: how I collaborate with AI, how I verify suggestions, and how I make decisions amid uncertainty — not by passively accepting tools, but by placing them inside my method.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i>This is an experiment—and it is deliberately “imperfect”</h2>

<ul class="custom-list">
<li><i class="fas fa-palette"></i><div><strong>Style inconsistency:</strong> because the lower section is generated in real time for different reports, visual styles and chart interactions may vary between pages.</div></li>
<li><i class="fas fa-code"></i><div><strong>Code standards and technical debt:</strong> AI-generated front-end code prioritizes “making it work” and may not meet the strictest industry standards, leaving room for future optimization.</div></li>
<li><i class="fas fa-expand-arrows-alt"></i><div><strong>Scalability limits:</strong> each report is generated in a highly customized way; this “craft-like” approach makes it hard to scale quickly to many pages.</div></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="rigor-box">
<div class="rigor-title"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>Academic rigor: how I address AI hallucination risk</div>

<p>
Although AI is powerful, accuracy is a non-negotiable red line when research is involved. When AI transforms content or generates charts, there remains a very small chance that it will produce something that looks plausible but is factually wrong—what we call “AI hallucinations.”
</p>

<ul class="custom-list rigor-list">
<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i><div><strong>Strict prompt constraints:</strong> I impose the tightest constraints, requiring AI to follow my original text exactly, allowing <strong>no</strong> invented content or excessive inference.</div></li>
<li><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i><div><strong>Transparency in models and calculations:</strong> when recalculations in economic models or mathematics differ even slightly from the original report, they are clearly marked and explained to keep everything transparent.</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
